Twisted's TLS support now provides a way to ask for user-configured trust roots rather than having to manually configure such certificate authority certificates yourself.  twisted.internet.ssl.CertificateOptions now accepts a new argument, trustRoot, which combines verification flags and trust sources, as well as a new function that provides a value for that argument, twisted.internet.ssl.platformTrust, which allows using the trusted platform certificate authorities from OpenSSL for certificate verification.
